Turn objbrowse into a package so it's easy to assemble a custom
browser with custom views and overlays. There should be a package for
the basic framework, and packages for the default views and overlays.

Put a nice symbol browser into a navigation panel. This may make the
whole thing a single-page experience.

Make it possible to hide and show view and turn overlays on and off.
Maybe make it possible to adjust their width.
